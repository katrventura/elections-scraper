### 2024 Elections Scraper

## Short Description:

This project aims to automate the scraping of data from the International Foundation for Electoral Systems website using Python, Playwright, and BeautifulSoup. With approximately 64 countries scheduled to conduct elections, the focus is on capturing voter turnout data from the latest elections held across the globe. The collected data is stored in a data.csv file which is updated daily, providing insights into global electoral trends and political landscapes.

## Data Collection Process:

Data is gathered from the election guide of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, accessible at IFES Election Guide.

## Data Analysis Process:

The analysis process involves comprehensive research and scraping of election data. The winning candidate's background and political affiliation are determined by the author, supplemented by additional research on the elections and pertinent information. News sources such as AP, Reuters, and Al Jazeera are utilized for gathering relevant data.

## New Skills and Approaches:

This project served as a platform to explore Adobe Illustrator for the first time. The graph generated from the data, graph-elections-with-resizer.svg, was converted into CSS and HTML using NYT's ai2html tool, enhancing the visualization aspect of the project.

## Future Enhancements:

Given more time and advanced skills, the project could incorporate dynamic updates to the graph, automatically reflecting the voter turnout of the latest elections. Implementing such functionality would likely involve utilizing technologies like D3.js for interactive data visualization.
